In this repo, I created data visualization using D3js (v4) and reactjs.

Actually, this repo is a collection of Free Code Camp's project assignment, which contain :
* Bar Chart
* Scatter Plot
* Heat Map
* Geographical


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
